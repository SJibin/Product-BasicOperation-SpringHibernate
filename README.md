# Product-BasicOperation-SpringHibernate

Simple application using spring and hibernate for basic operation in Product.
We can either register our app with Eureka server or else we can run it individually.
If we need to register it with eureka server use the anotation @EnableEurekaClient in the main class which I comment in this code.
